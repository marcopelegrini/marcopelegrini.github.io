## Quick note on my personality

I was born Brazilian 🇧🇷 with strong Italian 🇮🇹 influences. I'm very passionate, and you can see that in the way I interact with people and the world. It's not unusual to see me magnify issues that others wouldn't care about, and I carry a hint of perfectionism that I tend to apply to my life and my expectations of the world. All of this is a recipe for creating very heated, energetic, and passionate interactions. I always aspire to say things from a place of love, even when I'm criticizing banal things, for instance: that phrase that should've used the Oxford comma, so please bear with me. If I'm being too much for you, just tell me... I can handle it ;)

## What would be the perfect day for me?

Watch `The Bear - Season 4, Episode 4` (it helps if you know the show) - around minute 20 you'll find what I'm chasing in life!
