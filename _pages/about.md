I’m someone who has built a life around curiosity, responsibility, and the ongoing desire to create things that matter. I’m a father first; raising twins has shaped how I see the world, the pace I move at, and the patience I bring into every part of my life. Being present for them keeps me anchored and reminds me why I push myself to grow, learn, and stay balanced.

My work centers on software engineering and architecture. I spend most of my time designing systems that are stable, scalable, and actually useful—things people can rely on. I like diving into complex problems, shaping messy requirements into clean architecture, and collaborating with people who care about craftsmanship. I’ve worked on enterprise platforms, distributed systems, cloud-based services, and a variety of internal tools. When something works elegantly and efficiently, it feels like the closest thing to digital art.

I’m always exploring new technologies. Lately I’m especially interested in cloud-native design, high-performance Java and .NET, event-driven architectures, AI-assisted development, and the growing world of edge computing. I enjoy seeing how these tools shift what’s possible, and how they let small teams build things that once required entire companies. Innovation, when done with intention, feels like a superpower.

Outside of work, I’m involved in communities that build connection through creativity and service. Burning Man and similar nonprofit efforts inspire me. The idea of temporary cities, collaborative art, and shared responsibility resonates with my sense of community. I value the principle of leaving a place better than you found it, whether that’s a desert, a neighborhood, or a relationship. I’ve helped with volunteer initiatives, local events, and group projects where people come together to make something meaningful without expecting anything in return.

I try to stay hands-on in life. I like fixing things, improving things, and understanding how they work. Whether it’s a home project, a piece of tech, or a process that needs fine-tuning, I enjoy the challenge of making it function better. I’m the type of person who can’t resist taking things apart—physically or conceptually and putting them back together in a more thoughtful way.

At the core, I’m a builder, a dad, and someone committed to personal growth. I care about quality: in work, in relationships, in community, and in myself. I’m still figuring things out like everyone else, but I’m doing it with intention, curiosity, and a willingness to improve. Hi!
