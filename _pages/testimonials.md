    <h3>Peter Lorimer @ Microsoft</h3>
    <p>Peter and I worked together during my time on my first team at Microsoft. I hired Peter, impressed by his knowledge and passion for what he does. He not only took over some of the work I started on that team but also followed in my footsteps and moved to my next team. It's always a pleasure to work with you, Peter!</p>
