## PopRocks dispenser

In the BurningMan community I'm PopRocks 💥, a bit I do where I give people the classic exploding candy.

Dealing with the little bags is hard so I've built this dispenser that I load with the candy and I can easily distribute the perfect amount of happiness to everyone.

Built with:
- X1 Carbon 3D Printer
- Autodesk Fusion
- Roland printer (sticker)
