## PopRocks dispenser

In the BurningMan community I'm PopRocks 💥, a bit I do where I give people the classic exploding candy.

Dealing with the little pop rocks packages is hard so I've built this dispenser that I load with the candy and I can easily distribute the perfect amount of happiness to everyone.

Built with:

- X1C/P2S 3D Printer
- Autodesk Fusion
- Roland BN2-20 printer (sticker)
