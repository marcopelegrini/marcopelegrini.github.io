I've found an electric bike frame on the Facebook marketplace missing all the electrnic parts, so I bought it a rebuilt it myself. This is the battery I built for it:

Using 18650 cells from a battery I bought from the Facebook Marketplace and a new BMS I got from China, I've built a new battery with more capacity than the original, it runs for about 30km I believe.

I've designed the base to match the original the bike had and used XT-60 connectors that fit perpectly.

I charge it using a li-ion charger for Hooverboards.

The rest of the bike built will be documented in separate posts.

Built with:

- Autodesk Fusion 360
- HAKKO FX-888D Soldering Iron
- Ultrom 3D Printer
