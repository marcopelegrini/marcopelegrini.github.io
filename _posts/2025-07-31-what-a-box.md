I had some 18650 batteries laying around that I salvaged from broken devices and laptop batteries.

So I've decided to build my own battery bank:

Specifications:

- 250Wh (50,000mAh @ 5V)
- USB-A port
- USB-C PD port
- Lighter Plug
- Direct 16.8V XT-60 connector

Built with:

- Universal Laser Cutter
- HAKKO FX-888D Soldering Iron
- 18650 battery cells
- 9A 300w Step Down Buck Converter
- Small CPU fan
