## London's Calling

[The London's Calling](https://www.instagram.com/thelondonscalling/) is an art installation debuted at [Burn in The Forest](https://whatif.now/) (now WhatIf).

What if you could find a door which would allow you to communicate with others at distance while having a pretty personal experience? Have you talked to someone through the bathroom door?
London's Calling is the call for you to raise the bar on your communication paradigms. 💩 💦

The project comprises of the facelifting a few porta-potties (3 in its first appearance) as the iconic London telephone booth. Inside you'll find a replica of an old coin telephone which can be used to communicate with the other porta-potties in the event.

My friend - _[Sarah Haywood](https://www.instagram.com/haywood.sarahhaywood)_ - and I wanted to create an art project for the event to bring a fun and interactive attraction to the crowd.

Sarah quickly designed the façade while I started working on the communication parts. That's how the London's Calling came to existence.
