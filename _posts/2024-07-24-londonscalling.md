## London's Calling

The London's Calling is an art installation debuted on [Burn in the forest](https://whatif.now/) (now WhatIf).

It comprises of the facelifting a few porta-potties as the iconic London telephone booth. Inside you'll find a replica of an old coin telephone which can be used to communicate with the other porta-potties in the event.

My friend _Sarah Haywood_ and I wanted to create an art project for the event to bring a fun and interactive attraction to the crowd.

Sarah quicly designed the façade while I started working on the communication parts. That's how the London's Calling came to existence.
