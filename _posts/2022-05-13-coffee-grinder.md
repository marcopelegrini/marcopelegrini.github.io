## Coffee Grinder Adapter

The OTB plastic container creates too much static and coffee goes everywhere.
I've designed this so that I have a single serve coffee ground straight to a little cup that fits on my coffee machine portafilter.

The little cup also serves as a tamper.

Unfortunately, I don't have a photo of it installed.
