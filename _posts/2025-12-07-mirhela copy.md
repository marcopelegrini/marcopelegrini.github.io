Mirrela (correct spelling in Portuguese) is a cat me and my ex adopted in Brazil and brought to Canada.
During my ex's pregnancy, she decided to put her for adoption as she was afraid of the cat's interaction with the babies.

I still miss her very much and this is just a simple gesture to thank her for all the cuddles!

Love you Mirrela, wherever you are! ❤️

PS: Mirrela is a wordplay I invented, meaning "Pet me". My cousin used to tell me "Des me rela" meaning, don't touch me. I inverted the expression to mean "Me rela" or "Touch/Pet me". 😻

She has her own website too: [mirhela.com](https://mirhela.com)
