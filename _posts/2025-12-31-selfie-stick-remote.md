I have a selfie stick that has a handy bluetooth remote so you don't need to use the phone camera's timer.

The problem was that the battery died and it uses a weird battery size.

I wanted to use it in that day so I had an idea: why not replace it with a rechargeable lithium battery? Never buying battery again :)

Built with:

- HAKKO FX-888D Soldering Iron
