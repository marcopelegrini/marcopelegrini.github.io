I started building a big battery bank from repurposed 1850 cells. The project was going well, but then other cells started to fail and it became really hard to maintain.

I ended up abandoning it and using the cells in smaller projects, such as the [What-a-box](https://pelegrini.ca/utilities/2025/07/31/what-a-box/)

Built with:

- HAKKO FX-888D Soldering Iron
- Universal Laser Systems Laser Cutter
