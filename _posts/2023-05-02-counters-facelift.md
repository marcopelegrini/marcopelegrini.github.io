## Facelift of my rental counter tops

I live in this amazing tiny apartment in one of the best neighbourhoods of Vancouver, BC, but unfortunately I rent it and the place is pretty outdated.

Fear not, I've found a solution. Using IKEA tables I bought from Facebook Marketplace, I've given the existing countertops a facelift, keeping the original intact should I leave one day (not happening!).

New faucets and voilà, I can live in peace.

Check out the before and after photos:
