## Facelift of my rental counter tops

I live in this amazing tiny apartment in one of the best neighbourhoods of Vancouver - BC, but unfortunatelly I rent it and the place is pretty outadate.

Fear not, I've found a solution. Using IKEA Tables I've bought from the Facebook Marketplace, I've facelifted the existing countertops, keeping the original intact should I leave one day (not happening!).

New faucets and voilá, I can live in peace.

Check out the before and after photos:
