A friend invited me to collaborate in an art project to build an abstract tree, and hanging from the branches there would be about 300 [vintage electrical insulators](<https://www.wikiwand.com/simple/articles/Insulator_(electricity)> which would light up individually using addressable LED pixels.

I've started building the prototype using laser cut wood, a couple of insulators, a Raspberry Pi 3 development board and other materials.

Using X-Lights, a software typically used for Chrismas/Halloween decoration shows in houses, I've programmed a "show" for the tree.

The Raspberry Pi would have the software to drive the LED pixels driven by the program created using X-Lights.

In the pictures you see a screenshot of a 3D model of the tree being modeled inside X-Lights.

The tree would've been built using scrap metal, secured to the playa (Burning Man ground), and would have a security mechanism to prevent people from climbing it.

_Unfortunately, several factors contributed to the abandonment of the project, at least for the time being. If you're interested in this project, please contact me._

Built with:

- Raspberry Pi 3
- Vintage electric insulators
- X-Lights
- Adobe Illustrator
- Universal Laser Systems Laser Cutter
