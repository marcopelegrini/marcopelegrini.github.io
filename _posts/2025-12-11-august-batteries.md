I have an [August Smart Lock](https://august.com/products/august-wifi-smart-lock) and they require [Lithium 123](https://www.uline.ca/Product/Detail/S-24916/Batteries/Energizer-123-Lithium-Batteries-12-Pack) batteries which are expensive and don't last as long.

I've noticed that disposable vapes use a very similar 4.2v Rechargeable Li-Ion battery which is almost the same size.

So I've created my own rechargeable battery from 2 cells I rescued from 2 used vapes.

Adding nickel plates to the edges does the trick.

You can charge them with any Li-Ion battery charger such as [this one](https://www.amazon.ca/XTAR-Universal-Battery-Rechargeable-Batteries/dp/B0BRXBMC7J) which can also charge a bunch of other types of batteries.
Or you can go [very simple](https://www.amazon.ca/Lithium-Intelligent-Portable-Rechargeable-Charging/dp/B0FDWLLT9Z) with these cheap chargers.

Built with:

- Rescued 4.2 batteries
- HAKKO FX-888D Soldering Iron
- Nickel metal strips
- XTAR VC8
